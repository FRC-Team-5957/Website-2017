<div id="Body" class="team">
<p id="t1" style="text-indent:30px;">Heritage's FTC Robotics Team, The Cat 5 Cyber Canes (10570), is in its first year! This 2015-2016 season, we are entered into the FIRST Res-Q competition. In preparation for the event, we have divided into four sections in our team: Design, Marketing/Social Media, Programming, and Engineering. Design focuses on creating a virtual model for the robot. The Marketing/Social Media team works on our website and the three other social media platforms, Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter, which can be found on the left. The Programming team writes the instructions that enable the robot to move and function on its own during the autonomous period, and then during the driver controlled period. Last but not least, Engineering. They work with and assemble the robot that  the Design Team creates. There are also optional crews to join like Safety, Photography, Scouting, and Engineering Notebook.</p><br />
  
<p id="t1" style="text-indent:30px;">C5CC LOL has the Captain, Marissa Harris, the Co-Captain, David Davenport, the Design Lead, Darius Wills-Browne, the Programming Lead, Tristan Pfingsten, the Marketing/Social Media Lead, Aaron Greco, and the Engineering Lead, Caroline Mizell. Our Mentors are Rick Burgos and Fred Miles, and our wonderful coaches are Ms. Stein and Mrs. Callwood.</p><br /></div>

<p id="t1" style="text-indent:30px;">Heritage's FRC Robotics Team, The Cat 5 Cyber Canes (5957), is on it's first year! Our event schedule is available at the (N/A) page. We have four main teams: Design, Engineering, Programming, and Marketing/Social Media. The design of our robot is made in CAD by the Design team. Engineering works with the Design team to create the working physical version of the robot, including the assembling and wiring of the robot. The Programming team is what makes the robot move under Autonomous and Tele-Op. Marketing and Social Media raise funds for the team and get word out on social media about the team. There are also a few smaller teams we have which are only about two-three people.</p><br />
