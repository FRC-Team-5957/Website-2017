on a per-folder basis
loop that takes index of lines in .txt file and makes those captions as indexed per picture.

for years on the website
Legacy version will be only available by typing it in the address bar.

15-16 school year version will be available in folder 1516
16-17 school year version will be available in folder 1617
so on

create a format that will allow easy addition of years.
current year always goes in root folder. once year is over, move all files there into the corresponding year, then from base folder (root\base), copy latest version of default files.

index.html and gallery.html will always be the only pages where you can access the archived versions of the website.

gallery will have tabs on the left corresponding to the year, looking like the frc ftc buttons. you will also have a floating box in the top right which will label what year you are in.
